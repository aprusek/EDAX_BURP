Versions of BURP Binary


Usagi Electric
Heya!
Here's all the software we pulled off the tape.
EDAX_BinaryLoader.BIN: This is identical to the standard binary loader that's out and about
EDAX_BURP.BIN: This is the custom spun version of Dartmouth BASIC I featured in the video
EDAX_FrameSTD_fixed.BAS: This is a BASIC program for something spectrometer related
EDAX_7EP.BIN: This is a custom program for working with the spectrometer
EDAX_Patch.BIN: I believe this is a patch that gets loaded overtop of 7EP

I also included scans of the BURP and 7EP manuals. The BASIC program, FrameSTD, had some transfer issues as the tape was starting to fail, but we got enough of it that we could repair it and it loads and runs just fine now. No clue what it does though, lol. 7EP seems to work quite well too, and I showed using it briefly in the video, but it seems that a lot of it is unusable without a spectrometer or other piece of equipment.
